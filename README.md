# Grubby

# Inspiration
A lot of adolescents refuse to eat or dine out alone in fear of being judged for their lack of company. As students go to the dining commons, a lot of times it hurts to see a group of friends in another table while some do not have that kind of privilege. We hoped to combat that issue.

# What it does
Our app helps combat loneliness - if you are planning to dine out, our website informs you of other people who are planning to eat at the same location as well. This allows you to match with people of similar interests and potentially find a new friend, all while bonding over food

# How we built it 
We used React for our client side and Node JS and MySQL for our server side as we successfully employed Google Maps API along with HTML and CSS to create a full stack web application.

# Installation
* Install the node-modules : ```npm install``` in both client and server folders

* Run the Node.js server (server):
 ```node index.js```

* Run the React app (client):
 ```npm start```
